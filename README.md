# Space Shooter Demo

## Information

This is a short demo game I developed using assets from a Unity game dev course from GameDevHQ. I took the concepts taught in the course and implemented custom features, menus, and logic for this demo. It was a great introduction to OOP priciples!

To play the game, head to the itch.io page for [SpaceShooter](https://jess-daniel.itch.io/space-shooter-demo)

## Tech Stack

#### Unity, C#

Why did I choose this framework?

- Unity is a cross-platform game engine that allows developers to create 2D, 3D, VR and more experiences.
- C# is an Object-Oriented Programming language that is used not only in Unity for game development but also in the .NET framework for web development.

## How to Play

- Avoid being hit by the asteroids
- Shoot the asteroids by pressing the Space bar to score points

- Pickup upgrades for extra ammo, lives, and shields.
